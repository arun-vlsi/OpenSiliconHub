# 💡 Support OpenSiliconHub

OpenSiliconHub is an open-source initiative to build reusable Verilog modules for cryptography, PRNGs, DSP, and lightweight AI acceleration.  
So far, most of the work has focused on **design and verification**. To expand into **synthesis, hardware prototyping, and broader research opportunities**, we are seeking community support.

## 🎯 Why Donations?

- Provide **online FPGA access** so active contributors can work hands-on.  
- Move beyond simulation and verification into **real synthesis and hardware testing**.  
- Enable contributors to access **paid EDA tools** or additional FPGA boards when needed.  
- Strengthen collaboration by giving contributors practical hardware experience.

## 📌 Immediate Goal

Our first milestone is to purchase a **Tang Nano 20K FPGA board**.  
This will allow us to validate designs on real hardware and open the door to more advanced boards in the future.  

So far, we have received **$0.33 in donations** — every bit helps us move closer to this goal!
